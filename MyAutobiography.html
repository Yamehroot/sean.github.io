                <p> Sean Rian S. Bairon is my name, was born in Lapu-Lapu City on Thursday, 26th in September 26, 2002, as the first son of the children, my mother’s name is Rina Bairon. We are three siblings in the family. I am the eldest child. I have a sister and brother named Syanna Mae Bairon, and Kobi Bairon.</p>
                <p>Short story, I started to study at school. I graduated from kindergarten to elementary at Bankal Elementary, and High School in my Senior High School days I decided to study Computer Servicing System to pursue my dreams as well as to gain more knowledge. Then in College my mother let me decide where school I’m going to, and I chose Lapu-Lapu City College which I am currently studying BSIT Computer Technology.</p>
                <P>Throughout my life, I faced many challenges and obstacles. However, I always persevered and worked hard to overcome them. I was proud of the many achievements and successes I had in both my personal and professional life, including winning several awards for my work.</P>
                <p>Looking back on my life, I realize that the key to my success was always staying true to myself and my values. I learned to never give up on my dreams, to always work hard, and to treat others with kindness and respect. These lessons have served me well throughout my life, and I am grateful for the many opportunities and experiences I have had.</p>
